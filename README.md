React App - Study tool

Project Pitch: The aim of this web application is to provide the user with a site similar to Quizlet. This is a React front end application, using React hooks(including useState, useEffect, and useParams). The user should be able to utilize this application to see and create flashcard decks and cards.

User Stories: As a user, I should be able to:

- Create a new flashcard deck
- View created flashcard decks
- Create a new flashcard within a specific deck
- View a specific flashcard, and on click, the flashcard flips to see the answer
